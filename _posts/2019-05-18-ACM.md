## ACM Turing Celebration Conference

In addition to the main sessions, the conference will include workshops, panels, demonstrations, and exhibits. Domestic and international academic experts and professors including some ACM Turing Award winners will share their perspectives on cutting-edge technologies and explore the current trends in Artificial Intelligence.
